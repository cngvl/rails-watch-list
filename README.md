# README

The purpose of this Le Wagon challenge was to create a MVP of a three-model Rails app with a user, movie and list. This challenge was designed to consolidate n:n relationships model. The app was (poorly) styled using Bootstrap, and I intend on keeping it how it currently looks (as horrific as it looks) to serve as a 'reference point' so I can look back on in it the future and see how far I've progressed since I first started coding. 

* Ruby version
